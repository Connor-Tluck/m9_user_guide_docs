<Note>
  Mach9â€™s Digital Surveyor automates feature extraction from pre-processed datasets, then guides you through QA/QC and delivers final outputs ready for CAD or GIS workflows.
</Note>

Mach9 is a feature extraction software similar to existing extraction tools in the marketplace. Data acquisition, calibration, and processing is completed before uploading to Digital Surveyor.

Once data is uploaded, you define an **attribute template** to encapsulate all desired features. After templates are set, trigger a **perception request** to generate an initial draft of extracted features. Finally, perform **QA/QC** before exporting your deliverable.
